<i>Problem: Given an array containing n integers, find a non-empty,
 contiguous subarray having maximal sum and return that sum.</i>
<br><br>
Examples:<br>
[1, 2, 3, -6, 5] `=>` 6<br>
[4, -5, 3, 6, -1, 3] `=>` 11

The difficulty of this problem derives from two facts:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The subarray can contain negative integers. If this were not the case, the answer would simply be the sum of all
	elements in the array.</li>
	<li>The subarray must be contiguous. If this were not the case, we could simply add up all non-negative elements, or output
	the largest negative element if the entire array consisted only of negative integers.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Given these difficulties, the most obvious approach would be to try all `(n(n+1))/2` possible contiguous subarrays, 
each time summing all elements in the subarray and updating a running maximum sum. What is the time complexity of this approach?
There are clearly a quadratic number of subarrays to consider, but note that each summation in the inner loop is not a constant-time
operation. In fact, the total number of additions (just additions, not counting comparisons) required would be
</p>
$$0 \cdot n + 1 \cdot (n-1) + 2 \cdot (n-2) + ... + (n-1) \cdot 1 + n \cdot 0 = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {k(n-k)} = (n-1)n(n+1)/6$$
<p>
where we are adding up the number of subarrays of length k multiplied by the number of required additions per subarray.
Note that I evaluated the final summation using <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com">Wolfram Alpha</a>.

A cubic algorithm seems unacceptably slow for the given problem and, indeed, we can do better. Suppose that before trying
all possible subarrays, we first pre-compute an "integral array" where each element is the sum of all elements in the input
array, up to and including that index. Generating this array would take linear time, and it could be used to compute each
subarray sum in constant time, thus bringing the overall time complexity of the algorithm down to quadratic.
</p>

<p>
Is there a sub-quadratic algorithm? Consider making a single pass through the array while keeping track of a "candidate" subarray
at each step. Let's refer to this subarray as <b>c</b>. Initially, <b>c</b> will be the subarray consisting of only the first element in the input array. 
If the input array only contains one element, <b>c</b> is already optimal. If there is a second element, the question is whether
we should add it to <b>c</b>, or start over and include only the second element in <b>c</b>. Now we have the following cases:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<i>Both elements are non-negative</i> - In this case, there is no reason not to include both, since doing so would maximize
		the sum of elements in <b>c</b>, and there is no reason for any future version of <b>c</b> that includes the second element
		not to include the first as well.
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>First element is negative, second is non-negative</i> - In this case, we should start over with only the second element in <b>c</b>
		since including the first (negative) element would only harm any future version of <b>c</b> that included the second element. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>First element is non-negative, second element is negative</i> - In this case, the question is again whether a future version
		of <b>c</b> that included the second element would also benefit from including the first element. Since the first element is positive,
		the answer is obviously yes. In this case, however, we could make a further observation. If the sum of the first two elements is negative,
		then no future subarray could benefit from including both the first and second elements. However, let's stick with the simple rule of
		keeping both elements for now, and we will see later how this situation is handled.
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Both elements are negative</i> - In this case, we can also discard the first element, using the same reasoning as before.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
From these observations, we see that <b>c</b> should include both of the first two elements if and only if the first element is non-negative.
So far, we have only considered the first two elements in the input array. However, let's make the following observations:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		If we discard the first element in the input array, we can consider the remaining elements as a new input array, treat the
		second element as the new first element, and start over.
	</li>
	<li>
		If we keep both of the first two elements in the input array, we can do the same as in 1., but with the new first element
		being the sum of the original first two elements.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
Let's return briefly to the case mentioned before where the first element of the input array is positive but the sum of the first two
is negative. In this case, the new first element of the new input array will be negative, so it will be discarded from <b>c</b> in the
next step of the algorithm.
</p>

This approach is called Kadane's algorithm. A Python implementation is given below.
